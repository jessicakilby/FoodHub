# ðŸ“Š Food Hub
        
## Project Overview

This project explores order data from a food aggregator platform, where registered customers place orders through an online portal. The company aims to analyze this data to better understand restaurant demand patterns and enhance the overall customer experience.

As a newly hired Data Scientist, you're tasked with investigating key business questions provided by the Data Science team. Your analysis will uncover actionable insights to support strategic decisions and improve operational efficiency.

The dataset includes order-level details, and your work will focus on identifying trends, evaluating restaurant performance, and recommending data-driven improvements to optimize the platform's offerings.
        
## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: ETL, reporting logic, exploratory analysis and visualizations
- `venv/`: Virtual environment
        
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo or copy the folder
2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
        
## Key Scripts
- `FoodHub.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the full workflow for the project, including data import, cleaning, exploration, and analysis. It addresses core business questions using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and presents insights to support strategic decisions around restaurant demand and customer experience.

> **Disclaimer**: The Markdown content and analytical workflow within the notebook were provided by Great Learning as part of their instructional material. This includes the structure, prompts, and guiding questions for the analysis. All Python code cells, data cleaning, and exploratory work were authored independently.
